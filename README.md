# MSSCNet

This repository contains the code related to our paper **"Classifying natural and non-natural earthquakes based on multimodal data and neural networks"**.

The repository contains three Python scripts and one model weight file:  
- **train.py** – code for training the model.  
- **load_model.py** – code for loading the trained `model.pth` weights.  
- **utils.py** – utility functions used during the process.  
- **model.pth** – trained weights.
